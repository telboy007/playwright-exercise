# playwright-exercise

Simple playwright example that checks a google search.

Some features:
* Powered by github actions and utilises parallelisation+
* Project config matches certain test folders
* Organises video, screenshots and trace files into folders based on test info rather than uuid filenames
* JUnit results can be uploaded to a 3rd party service to monitor trends.

+ Sharding is over the top for a single test across two browsers but is shown for illustrative purposes only.
